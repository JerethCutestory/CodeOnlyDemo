Application
  Window
    Content View Hierarchy <= View Controller
      Root View
        Subviews

> In a single screen in an application, Views are stacked on top of each other in a Content View Hierarchy
  - The hierarchy is managed by a single View Controller
> Applications with multiple screens have multiple Content View Hierarchies, each with its own View Controller
  - The application places Views in the Window to create a different Content View Hierarchy based on the screen that the user is on
